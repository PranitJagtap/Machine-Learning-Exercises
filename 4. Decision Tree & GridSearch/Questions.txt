2. Use the German credit rating dataset “German Credit Data.csv” , Decision tree
classifier to predict good or bad credit. Use “sklearn.model_selection” and 
GridSearchCV to search the hyperparameter values and report the most optimal 
one. Configure the grid search to search for optimal parameters:
• Splitting criteria: gini or entropy.
• Maximum depth of decision tree ranging from 2 to 10.
• The searching of optimal parameter will be validated using 10-fold cross 
validation and the most optimal parameter will be chosen based on ROC 
AUC score.
2. Visualize the tree using graphviz software.
3. Display the text representation of the rules learnt.

Download fuel consumption dataset "FuelConsumption.csv", which contains modelspecific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions. 
• Select the features 'ENGINESIZE', 'CYLINDERS', 
'FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB', 'CO2EMISSIONS' to use for building the 
model. Plot Emission values with respect to Engine size.
• split the data into training and test sets (70:30) to create a model using training 
set, evaluate the model using test set, and use model to predict unknown value.
• Try to use a polynomial regression with the dataset of degree 2, 3, 4, 5 and verify 
the accuracy by calculating Mean absolute error, Residual sum of squares, R2-
score.
