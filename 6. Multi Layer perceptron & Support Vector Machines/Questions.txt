6. Write down the meta information about the “wine.csv” data file available in the 
UCI repository, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine.
7. Tabulate and visualize the distribution of the numeric variables.
8. Perform the required preprocessing , 70,30 split and build a classifier using the 
Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier model available in SciKit Learn. Use 3 layers 
with the same number of neurons as there are features along with 500 max 
iterations.
9. Tabulate the precision, recall and F1-score.
10. Display the MLP weights and biases after training your model.

6. Tabulate and visualize the distribution of the numeric variables.
7. Perform the required preprocessing , 70,30 split and build a classifier using the 
SVM model available in SciKit Learn.
8. Tune the hyperparameters of kernel (linear, polynomial, and radial basis), 
regularization and gamma. Tabulate the model performance and comment on 
the best model found for the given dataset.
