EXER 1
Consider the dataset 'weatherAUS' called Rain in Australia. It describes the weather 
characteristics on different dates and locations. This dataset contains about 10 years of 
daily weather observations from many locations across Australia.
6. Preprocess the data, remove the attributes which were are not useful to predict 
rain. Also, remove rows with at least one missing value for each of them. 
7. Calculate the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) value. VIF is a number that 
determines whether a variable has multicollinearity or not (starts from 1, and it 
has no upper limit. If the number gets larger, it means the variable has huge 
multicollinearity on it.). 
8. Remove multicollinearities by creating new features. Find the features that have 
paired values and create the new feature which is the difference value between 
those pairs.
9. Remove features that have a VIF value above 5.
10.Build a regression model to perform the Rain prediction. Also, tabulate accuracy 
of the prediction models, before and VIF computation.
EXER 2
Consider the 'HousePrice.csv' dataset which describes the features and sale price of a 
house. Build a regression model using regularization to predict the value of the 
properties.
4. Perform the preprocessing if required, scale the train and test data using standard 
scaler.
5. Split the dataset into train size of 70% and test size of 30% and Apply the Ridge 
and Lasso regression and fit the model containing all independent variables.
6. Make predictions on test data “HousePriceTest.csv” and tabulate performance of 
both models on unseen data.
