Exercise 1
1. Write a user defined function ‘myFnLinReg(x,y)’ to perform Simple Linear 
Regression given one predictor attribute and one response attribute. The 
function should return the coefficients of the straight line.
2. Use mtcars data set and consider the attributes mpg and weight. Split data into 
train and test sets (70 %,30%). Put training data set to ‘myFnLinReg(x,y)’ to 
build a linear regression model to predict mpg given the weight of the car.
3. What is the mpg of a car, whose weight is 6.7?
4. Compute and print accuracy measures such as RMSE and R2 for the test set. 
5. Apply the stochastic gradient descent and mini batch gradient descent 
algorithms to enhance the accuracy and visualize the cost function.

Exercise 2
1. Use the boston.csv dataset and determine the best 5 features to predict 
‘MEDV’. 
2. Using sklearn.linear_model, find the multiple regression model for the 
boston.csv dataset using the best 4 features. (from sklearn.linear_model import 
LinearRegression) 
3. Find the accuracy of the model using appropriate metrics using 80, 20 split for 
training and test
